Collaborative crafting tool for Final Fantasy XIV:

FFXIV Teamcraft is a collaborative tool for Final Fantasy XIV, a MMORPG video game with  extensive and complicated crafting and gathering systems. The software is designed to help players track crafting projects and collaborate with others. It's meant to be used in concert with the game, as either a web app or a desktop app.

The nature of Final Fantay XIV is that it, like many other online multiplyer games, receives updates (patches) on a frequent basis, usually every 2-4 months. It's an ever-expanding universe with ever-growing crafting and gathering systems, which means that new items and player abilities are added and modified on a frequent basis. FFXIV Teamcraft is constantly expanding with new features and improving to better meet the needs of players, growing and changing alongside the game it serves. 

Many aspects of Final Fantasy XIV are planned around player cooperation. For instance, players join Free Companies, which are plsyer-run organizations resembling the guilds of other fantasy games. Free Companies with in-game housing are able to utilize a Company Workshop, with many challenges like ship-building and ventures intended for players to work together to build. This can be quite an administrative burden, so Teamcraft has numerous sections for tracking progress and sharing projects with others. The Lists feature helps players keep a running To-Do list, streamlining the process of bulk crafting and gathering.

Some of the most popular features of FFXIV Teamcraft are the Crafting Simulator and Crafting Rotations, which allow players to input their gear stats and miscellaneous buffs to maximize their rate of crafting success. The Gearsets feature helps players choose from preset armor guides curated by game experts. Final Fantasy XIV has hundreds of Unspoiled and Ephemeral items that are only available at certain times or under certain conditions, so the Alarm feature helps players track rare items and plan a maximal gathering rotation. These features and many more are constantly developed, honed, and fixed as the game grows.
